Throughout the NoteEarly application screens, I've used a consistent color system that works across both light and dark modes. Here's a breakdown of the main colors and how they're used:
Primary Colors:

Primary Blue:

Light mode: #FEAC3E
Dark mode: #E69C38
Used for: Call-to-action buttons, progress indicators, highlights, and interactive elements

Purple:

Light mode: #B19CD9
Dark mode: #9F89C9
Used for: Logo background, subscription badges, secondary accents, and Pro plan indicators

Background Colors:

Used for: Content cards, modules, and content containers

Light Background:

Text Colors:

Primary Text:

Other Special Colors:

The system adapts between light and dark modes by:

Maintaining color relationships while adjusting brightness/saturation
Ensuring adequate contrast ratios for accessibility
Using slightly desaturated colors in dark mode to reduce eye strain
Preserving the same semantic meaning of colors across both modes

This color system is designed to create a visually cohesive experience throughout the application while being appropriate for both adults (admin/teacher interfaces) and children (student reading view).
