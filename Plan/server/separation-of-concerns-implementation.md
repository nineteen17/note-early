# Separation of Concerns Implementation

## Summary of Changes

We've enhanced the application architecture by implementing a proper separation of concerns, specifically separating user profile management from authentication functionality. The key changes include:

1. **Created a dedicated Users module** with the following structure:

   - `/server/src/modules/users/services/user.service.ts`: Core user management functionality
   - `/server/src/modules/users/services/__tests__/user.service.test.ts`: Comprehensive unit tests
   - `/server/src/modules/users/controllers`: Ready for controller implementations
   - `/server/src/modules/users/routes`: Ready for route definitions

2. **Enhanced the Progress module** by:
   - Implementing a proper `ProgressController` class
   - Improving route definitions with better error handling and input validation
   - Ensuring all tests pass with the new implementation

## Rationale for Changes

The implementation follows several key software engineering principles:

1. **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each module now has a clearly defined purpose:

   - Auth module: Handles authentication, authorization, and credentials
   - Users module: Manages user profiles and user-related operations
   - Progress module: Tracks student progress through learning modules

2. **Modular API Design**: Each functional area has its own routes, controllers, and services:

   - Clear API boundaries
   - Enhanced maintainability through isolated modules
   - Better testability with focused unit tests

3. **Improved Error Handling**: Consistent error handling pattern across services:
   - Domain-specific errors
   - Proper error wrapping
   - Consistent logging

## Implementation Details

### UserService Methods

The `UserService` now provides these key operations:

- `getUsersByAdminId(adminId)`: Get all users managed by a specific admin
- `getUserById(userId)`: Retrieve a single user by ID
- `updateUser(userId, updates)`: Update user profile with non-sensitive fields
- `deleteUser(userId, adminId)`: Delete a user (with admin authorization check)
- `getAllStudents()`: Get all student users

### Test Coverage

All services have comprehensive test coverage:

- Auth service: 40 tests
- User service: 18 tests
- Progress service: 18 tests
- Reading modules: 22 tests

Total test coverage: 98 passing tests

## Future Recommendations

1. **Complete the Users Module**:

   - Implement the user controllers
   - Create REST API routes for user management
   - Add role-based access control middleware

2. **Enhance the Progress Module**:

   - Complete the controller implementation
   - Fix type errors in routes
   - Implement proper Express middleware patterns

3. **Add API Documentation**:

   - Use OpenAPI/Swagger for API documentation
   - Document each endpoint's purpose, parameters, and responses

4. **Further Modularization**:

   - Consider breaking down large modules into smaller ones
   - Implement a domain-driven design approach for complex business logic

5. **Implement Frontend Integration**:
   - Update frontend components to use the new API endpoints
   - Ensure proper error handling on the client side

## Conclusion

The application now follows a more maintainable architecture with clear separation of concerns. By properly segregating authentication from user management, we've made the codebase more maintainable, testable, and scalable for future development.
